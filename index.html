      THE JOURNEY
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hardangervidda is a mountain plateau ("vidde" in Norwegian) in central southern Norway, covering parts of the counties of Buskerud, Hordaland and Telemark. It is the largest plateau of its kind in Europe, with a cold year-round alpine climate, and one of Norway's largest glaciers, Hardangerjøkulen, is situated here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the plateau is protected as part of Hardangervidda National Park. Hardangervidda is a popular tourist and leisure destination, and it is ideal for many outdoor activities. The region is divided administratively between the counties of Buskerud, Hordaland, and Telemark.

      Odda - Trolltunga
    </h1>
    <p>
      Day 1 (travel day)
      After an early flight to Bergen, we took the bus to bergen center (kronen ea?). Upon arrival we faced a problem, buying gas cartridges. All outdoor shops near the central station in Bergen didn't sell our type of gas bottles, type c206. From here Bergen we took the bus to Odda, duration 3/4hr, nice scenery and ferry ride. We set up camp near a lake, did our final groceries and found a solution to our gas bottle problem. We also made a reservation at oddataxi.com for a bus pick up that will bring us to Skegjedall (Base camp at the foot of the mountain). Departure time: 7.10am, last shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 2 (the endless climb)
      We packed early morning and started our climb at 8.30am. Packed with 20kg we climbed a steep muddy path, we went from 80m to 1500m. Couldn't believe what I got myself involved in, felt like turning around. Tip: pack light.
      We walked all day through light rain to Trolltunga. We took some pictures but not on the tongue due to the queue, since we knew we would set up camp at Trolltunga due to the fact that we were exhausted we decided to make the popular photo on the tongue the next morning.
      Once the rain and cold picked up we decided to explore a nearby abandoned hut, we ended up sleeping on the floor of this hut. We met some fellow travelers who planned the same route for the next day.

      Trolltunga - Tyssevassbu
    </h1>
    <p>
     Day 3 (Short but though)
     After 12 hours of sleep with many wake ups due to the cold we set off to Tyssevassbu. It was a very though walk to get to Tyssevassbu, our bodies were still in shock of the previous day. This walk also had multiple steep climbs which are the most annoying. We decided to recharge in the warmth of the hut and continue the next day for a 9 hour hike through snow, climbs and harsh weather (rain, heavy gusts of wind). The hut allowed us to dry our clothes and equipment (355 kronen)and they also sell food. The reindeer meatballs caught my interest, but we ended up eating our own food because we were overpacked on food.
   </p>
   <p>
    The weather predictions were even worse for the next two days, heavy rain and wind. We therefor decided to sleep early and dump some excess food. The next day would be the longest hike so far - 9 hours non stop - through wind, heavy rain and on glaciers. Splitting up this hike in two days wasn't an option due to the harsh underground and weather forecast. We decided to do this hike with two fellow guys from Germany for safety sake.

    <p>
     Day 4(don't think just keep marching)
     We started at 8.30am with our fellow travelers from Germany. We packed our bags the previous evening so we started of good with a large energy-rich breakfast. Our fellow travelers took the lead since they attempted to walk it the previous day and thus knew the route. The first few hours we crossed slippery glaciers, the scenery was b-e-a-tifull.
   </p>
   <p>
     We skipped lunch due to the fact that standing still would cool us down very quickly costing us valuable energy. We made minute breaks to drink and grab energy bars & nuts. Doing this walk together with our fellow travelers was a very wise decision, we helped each other crossing glacier rivers and we pushed each other to the limit allowing us to keep up pace and thus time... We knew the end reward would be a new warm hut to dry our equipment and clothes. After crossing a glacier river bare feet and knee deep we had to keep moving, we walked the final 4 hours non stop. The two huts were packed due to the weather, 36 people. (Sick, pain, cold, nauseous -lay down back pain, soup life saver)(glacier slide broken road)

      Torehytten - Hadlaskar
    </h1>
    <p>
      The next morning we were the last to leave the hut so that we could regain powers. When we started walking we immmidiately felt our feet and legs from the day before. But we were promised that remaining part of the journey would be less tough and more beautiful. Only after walking for a few hours we could already see more green and there were less steep climbs.
      A six hour walk brought us to Hadlaskar, a much calmer area of the Hardangervidaa PLateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here on forth the weather cleared up and we even got a little bit of sun. We were now officially on the "Plateau". This day we stopped a few times to enjoy the view and to do some fishing. The latter unsuccesfull :), at least until the end of the day. Once we arrived at Hadlaskar, we found out that there were multiple good fishing spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      So after we arrived and settled we decided to gear up and go outside to catch some fish. In the region we have a lot of Rainbow Trout, a hunter fish which can be caught by lure-fishing. Within 10 minutes I caught the first fish, that it slipped of the hook and got away didn't bother me so much. I wasn't looking forward to killing the fish. When Friso caught the second one we decided that we should eat it and therefore we decapitated the fish. It may have been the freshest fish we have ever eaten but delicious it was for sure.
